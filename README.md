This is an analysis of The Movie Database data set. With this data, I will be examining the following questions: 

Have movies gotten longer or shorter over the years?
Have movie budgets increased over the years?
Have profits increased?
What is the most common genre?
What are the most profitable movies?
Which months are associated with higher profits?
Are there any very strong correlations in the data?
